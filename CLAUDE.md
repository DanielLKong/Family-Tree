# Family Tree Project - CLAUDE.md

## Section 1: User Profile

**Background:** Complete beginner, no prior coding experience. Not technical but intellectually curious about how things work.

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand concepts at a high level (the "what" and "why")
- Not aiming to become a coder, but wants to understand architecture and decisions
- Build transferable understanding of how software projects come together

**Learning Style:**
- "Vibe coding" approach — I build, they observe, I summarize when done
- Questions come naturally after seeing results, not during building
- Prefers seeing things work first, then understanding why

**Communication Preference:**
- Check in after each visual change (anything they can see/test)
- Iterate in small parts, start small and build up
- Summaries after completing work, not play-by-play during

**Constraints:** No timeline pressure. Quality and understanding over speed.

## Section 2: Communication & Teaching Style

**After completing work:**
- Give a high-level summary of what was built
- Explain how it fits into the bigger picture
- Use analogies and plain language
- Invite questions: "Want me to explain any part of that?"

**Concepts to explain:**
- Architecture decisions and why certain approaches were chosen
- How different pieces connect together
- Trade-offs when they affect user experience

**Keep automatic:**
- All code implementation details
- Technical setup and configuration
- Syntax and programming specifics
- Bug fixes and debugging

## Section 3: Project Overview

**What we're building:** A Family Tree website where users can visually map out their family in a flowchart/org-chart style.

**Inspiration:** Slack and Workday org charts — clean, clickable, hierarchical.

**Target users:**
- Phase 1: Personal use (Daniel's family)
- Phase 2: Other families (accounts, sharing, collaboration)

**Success criteria:**
- Can navigate through extended family visually
- Can add people and relationships (child, parent, spouse)
- Can click on someone to see their profile
- Clean, zoomable interface with generations aligned horizontally

## Section 4: Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Visual Tree (Current)
- [x] Align on visual style with example family tree
- [ ] Display generations in horizontal rows
- [ ] Clean, zoomable interface
- [ ] Warm and personal aesthetic

### Phase 2: Manual Editing
- [ ] Add a family member
- [ ] Define relationships (parent, child, spouse)
- [ ] Edit/remove members

### Phase 3: Profiles
- [ ] Click on person to see profile card
- [ ] Name, aliases, occupation
- [ ] Family connections (spouse, children, parents)

### Phase 4: Collaboration (Future)
- [ ] User accounts and login
- [ ] Share tree with edit/view permissions
- [ ] Photo uploads
- [ ] Multiple families/trees

## Section 5: Visual Design Direction

**Style:** Warm and personal
- Soft, inviting colors (not harsh corporate blues)
- Rounded edges, gentle shadows
- Feels like a family keepsake, not a business tool
- Clean but not sterile

**Interaction model:**
- Zoom in/out to navigate generations
- Click on person to see details
- Clear visual hierarchy (generations on horizontal lines)

**Design Tool:**
Always use the `frontend-design` skill (plugin:frontend-design@claude-plugins-official) when creating or updating UI components. This ensures:
- Distinctive, production-grade design quality
- Avoids generic AI aesthetics
- Professional polish and thoughtful details

## Section 8: Questions & Curiosities

*Space for questions that come up during building.*
